  "co2_eduaction_card_text_1": "CO2, ie carbon dioxide, is released into the atmosphere by us humans. CO2 is therefore logically concentrated in rooms that are not sufficiently ventilated.",
  "co2_eduaction_card_title_2": "Health effects of CO2",
  "co2_eduaction_card_text_2": "Staying in an area with an increased concentration of CO2 can cause health problems such as burning eyes, headaches, or fatigue. Your productivity is declining very quickly.",
  "co2_eduaction_card_title_3": "What is the ideal CO2 concentration?",
  "co2_eduaction_card_text_3": "Increasing CO2 concentrations in the human body are manifested by symptoms of fatigue, malaise or headaches. The optimal concentration of CO2 indoors is therefore less than 1000 ppm, ie parts per million.",
  "co2_eduaction_card_title_4": "Why monitor CO2",
  "co2_eduaction_card_text_4": "We spend almost 90% of our time in closed rooms. The usual urge to ventilate the interior is the feeling of 'exhaled air', but it is usually too late, because the CO2 concentration in the interior has already reached values ​​where it has a negative effect on our health. In addition, modern buildings are now so impermeable that there is almost no natural exchange of air. And all the carbon dioxide thus collects inside the building.",
  "co2_eduaction_card_title_5": "Morbidity and CO2",
  "co2_eduaction_card_text_5": "Many studies have shown that high concentration has a significant share in the morbidity, and therefore the absence, of employees. The fact is that at the optimal CO2 concentration, employees are the most productive and healthy, and therefore staff costs can be significantly reduced.",
  "temp_eduaction_card_title_1": "What is the ideal temperature?",
  "temp_eduaction_card_text_1": "The room temperature should be around 20 °C. But women perceive the cold earlier than men. According to a study published on the PLOS One science platform, men feel best at 22 °C, while women prefer around 25 °C.",
  "temp_eduaction_card_title_2": "The effect of bad temperature on health",
  "temp_eduaction_card_text_2": "Dry warm air clearly has a negative effect on our health. The upper and lower respiratory tracts dry out, causing an irritating cough, feelings of a stuffy nose or scratches in the throat.",
  "temp_eduaction_card_title_3": "How to save energy?",
  "temp_eduaction_card_text_3": "In addition to maintaining optimal room temperatures, ie around 20 °C. also think about lowering the temperature when you are not at home. Before leaving, set the temperature in the apartment to 16 °C and raise it again when you return.",
  "temp_eduaction_card_title_4": "Influence of temperature on productivity",
  "temp_eduaction_card_text_4": "According to a study by researchers at Helsinki University of Technology, workplace productivity increases at 21 ° C to 22 ° C. According to the study, the most productive are employees whose workplace temperature is maintained at 22°C.",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_title_1": "Consequences of poor humidity",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_text_1": "If the humidity is too low, our upper respiratory tract dries out, which leads to its diseases. High humidity is generally associated with the formation of mold.",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_title_2": "What is the ideal humidity?",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_text_2": "The recommended correct humidity in the apartment is 45 to 60% in winter and 40 to 55% in summer. It should always be between 40% and 60%.",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_title_3": "Reasons for poor humidity in the room ",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_text_3": "Humidity rises during activities such as cooking, showering, bathing or drying clothes. Among other things, it is also affected by the technical condition of the apartment or house.",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_title_4": "What is humidity?",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_text_4": "It is a basic property of air that indicates in percentage how much water vapor the air contains. Humidity changes throughout the year. Humidity is higher in the afternoon than in the morning, in summer than in winter and in larger bodies of water. This is logical because it is related to the evaporation of water.",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_title_5": "Proper heating",
  "humidity_eduaction_card_text_5": "The winter months are ideal for the spread of viruses and bacteria. The biggest contributors to this are the heating season and the heating itself, during which the air dries out and causes low humidity. The mentioned dry air damages our skin of pets, houseplants and affects the appearance of our furniture.",
  "pressure_eduaction_card_title_1": "What is air pressure?",
  "pressure_eduaction_card_text_1": "Air pressure is a quantity that tells us the amount of force that acts at a given point in the atmosphere perpendicular to a square meter. It is measured in pascals (Pa).",
  "pressure_eduaction_card_title_2": "What affects air pressure",
  "pressure_eduaction_card_text_2": "The magnitude of atmospheric pressure is affected by air temperature, water vapor content of the atmosphere, altitude and latitude.",
  "pressure_eduaction_card_title_3": "Average pressure",
  "pressure_eduaction_card_text_3": "The value of normal atmospheric pressure is 1013.25 hPa. However, the pressure decreases with altitude, so the values from different weather stations must be converted to sea level.",
  "voc_eduaction_card_title_1": "What is VOC?",
  "voc_eduaction_card_text_1": "VOC stands for volatile organic compounds, which are an integral part of exhaled air. Their higher concentration has a negative effect on human health.",
  "voc_eduaction_card_title_2": "What is the source of VOC?",
  "voc_eduaction_card_text_2": "The source of volatile organic compounds are building materials, furniture, carpets, but also air fresheners, cleaning agents and can even be released, for example, from printed matter or electronics.",
  "voc_eduaction_card_title_3": "Influence of VOC on health",
  "voc_eduaction_card_text_3": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are substances that have a negative effect on human health. Some volatile substances have allergic, others toxic effects or respiratory problems.",
  "voc_eduaction_card_title_4": "What you didn't know yet",
  "voc_eduaction_card_text_4": "It may also be interesting to note that VOCs are substances that damage the ozone layer in the presence of sunlight. With sufficient room ventilation, excessive interior overheating and the replacement of chemicals with natural ones, the VOC concentration can be reduced to a minimum.",
  "voc_eduaction_card_title_5": "Influence of VOC on productivity",
  "voc_eduaction_card_text_5": "Workplace air quality plays a significant role in employee productivity and health. That is why it is extremely important to prevent substances (here specifically VOCs) from entering our atmosphere as much as possible. Do not buy products with VOCs, and if this is not possible without them, store them in well-ventilated places, as the impact of VOCs on a person in an enclosed room is devastating.",
